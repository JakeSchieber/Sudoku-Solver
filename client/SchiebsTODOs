Where are we? lol

"setSquare" seems to be the major point that we dropped off at

IsSolved
Check whether additional input breaks - if so pass what is wrong and reflect in UI - special behavior for "known" vs "added"

Handle input function needs an updated react callback (pass function pointer instead)



WHERE DID I LEAVE OFF?
Conflict locations is broken + input sanitization
Conflict locations is attempting to use global index but square key is indexing on local box index, provided locations relies on local location
TODO is to figure out whether the global or local index was a better idea and then get both using it accordingly.
